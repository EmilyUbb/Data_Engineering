## Connecting Weather and Location Information for Road Trip Planning
Emily Ubbelode

### Need: 
When planning a road trip weather is an important condition to consider. Leaving 12 hours earlier can ensure you miss a big weather event, or dangerous road conditions. When planning a road trip currently you have to first look for cities along the route, and then turn to a weather app to get conditions along the way. The lack of integration between these two services is frustrating, and makes planning time consuming. Combining this publicly available information, will lead to an upgraded experience for anyone planning a road trip. 


### Data:
Location data for the route will be gathered using Google Maps API. Waypoints path information from the route will then be sent to the Dark Sky API to gather weather data along the path. The information will be compiled into an app which will give weather forecasts for three different departure times.

### Tools: 
Google Maps API
Dark Sky API


### MVP Goal:
Have a thorough pipeline connecting Google Maps API and Dark Sky API data to create an app or dashboard with.
