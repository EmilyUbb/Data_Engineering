## Compiling Weather Data for a Trip
Emily Ubbelohde

#### Work to Date

The majority of my work so far has been connecting to and understanding the data gathered from the three different API calls needed for my pipeline. I am currently working through formatting data from my each API call so it can seamlessly feed into the next API. 

#### Completion Goals for the Week

Getting a working app or dashboard where a user can input their starting and ending point for a trip and displaying the weather for the entirety of the trip for each city. I have three major stretch goals. The first would include having different options for if the user leaves now, in 12 hours, in 24 hours. The second would be to have the weather predicted specifically for the time you are expected to pass through the city. The third stretch goal would be to add an option stopping cities and durations along the way for longer road trips.

#### Below is a flowchart for the minimum goal I laid out for this week.
